BEGINNER: What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?
Definition:
Dynamic Programming is a way to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing results so we don't solve the same subproblem again.

🔍 1D vs 2D DP: What's the difference?
Use Case	1D DP Array	2D DP Array
You care about only one value (e.g. total count, max value)	✅ Yes	❌ Not needed
You care about two variables (e.g. strings, grid, choices)	❌ Not enough	✅ Needed

✅ STAGE 1: BEGINNER EXAMPLE — FIBONACCI (1D DP)
🎯 Problem: Find the nth Fibonacci number
Fibonacci: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

java
Copy
Edit
public class FibonacciDP {
    public static int fib(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1]; // 1D array to store results
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;

        // Build the solution bottom-up
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Store result
        }

        return dp[n]; // Return the nth Fibonacci
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Fib(6): " + fib(6)); // Output: 8
    }
}
🧠 Why 1D?
We only need to store values for each n. One dimension is enough!

✅ STAGE 2: INTERMEDIATE EXAMPLE — 0/1 KNAPSACK (2D DP)
🎯 Problem: Max value in a knapsack with weight limit
java
Copy
Edit
public class Knapsack01 {
    public static int knapsack(int[] weights, int[] values, int capacity) {
        int n = weights.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1]; // 2D array

        // i = items, w = capacity
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
                if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                    // Max of taking or skipping item
                    dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][w], values[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w]; // Can't take the item
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][capacity]; // Max value possible
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] weights = {2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] values = {3, 4, 5, 6};
        int capacity = 5;

        System.out.println("Max knapsack value: " + knapsack(weights, values, capacity)); // Output: 7
    }
}
🧠 Why 2D?
We track both:

Number of items (i)

Current capacity (w)

Hence, 2 dimensions are needed.

✅ STAGE 3: ADVANCED EXAMPLE — LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE (2D DP)
🎯 Problem: Find the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings.
java
Copy
Edit
public class LCS {
    public static int longestCommonSubsequence(String a, String b) {
        int m = a.length();
        int n = b.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1]; // 2D array

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (a.charAt(i - 1) == b.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    // Characters match
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    // Take max of skipping one char
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n]; // Length of LCS
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String a = "abcde";
        String b = "ace";

        System.out.println("LCS Length: " + longestCommonSubsequence(a, b)); // Output: 3
    }
}
🧠 Why 2D?
We compare two strings — their characters and positions. So we need dp[i][j] to mean:

"LCS of first i characters of string A and first j characters of string B."

📘 SUMMARY CHEATSHEET
Problem	Uses 1D or 2D	Reason
Fibonacci	1D	Only depends on n
Climbing Stairs	1D	Depends on previous few steps
House Robber	1D	Depends on previous values
0/1 Knapsack	2D	Depends on weight and items
Coin Change	1D or 2D	1D if order doesn’t matter
Longest Common Subsequence	2D	Comparing two strings
Edit Distance	2D	Comparing insert/delete between two strings
Grid Paths	2D	Depends on rows and columns

🧠 TIP: Optimize Space
Sometimes, even in 2D DP, we can reduce space to 1D if we only need current and previous rows.

Awesome! Here's a step-by-step Dynamic Programming (DP) Practice Sheet — from Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced, with hints, problem goals, and links to full working Java solutions.

🟢 Beginner Level (1D DP)
These problems focus on simple subproblem building, often using a 1D array.

#	Problem	Goal	Hint	DP Type
1	Climbing Stairs	Ways to reach the top using 1 or 2 steps	Like Fibonacci	1D Bottom-up
2	Fibonacci Number	Find the nth Fibonacci number	dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]	1D
3	House Robber	Max sum with no adjacent houses	Max between robbing or skipping	1D
4	Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs	Min cost to reach the top	dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])	1D
5	Coin Change (Min Coins)	Fewest coins to make a sum	Try all coins less than i	1D (Unbounded)

public class OneDDPTemplate {
    public static int solve(int[] input) {
        int n = input.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = input[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], input[i]); // change logic per problem
        }

        return dp[n - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println("Result: " + solve(arr));
    }
}
🟡 Intermediate Level (2D DP)
These require you to manage 2 variables — like index, capacity, or two strings.

#	Problem	Goal	Hint	DP Type
6	0/1 Knapsack	Max value with weight limit	Either take or skip item	2D dp[i][w]
7	Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)	Max matching subsequence in order	dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1] if match	2D
8	Edit Distance	Min insert/delete/replace to convert string	If chars match, no cost	2D
9	Unique Paths (Grid)	Ways to go from top-left to bottom-right	Sum of top and left	2D Grid
10	Coin Change (Ways to Make Amount)	Total ways to reach amount	Nested loops: amount and coins	2D or optimized 1D

        // Fill DP table

                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("LCS: " + solve("abcde", "ace"));
    }
}
🔴 Advanced Level (Optimization, 2D to 1D, DP with State)
These problems involve optimization, multiple states, or need careful transitions.

#	Problem	Goal	Hint	DP Type
